#~# Read Me file for the DOCDOC (DOCument DOCker) system of documenting docker files
#~# TODO: Add --help option to docdoc.sh to cat this file to screen

# The  docdoc.sh  bash script provides high level documentation for files stored in /etc/docker_qmul/*

# The script is currently to be found at  dev-centos7-doc-01:/usr/local/bin/docdoc.sh

# There is a soft link to  docdoc  for convenience


# The script searches all regular files for a comment tag  #~#  using the linux find command

# Regular comments can still be added to files but the will not get reported by DOCDOC


# The starting point is always the Present Working Directory (PWD) and will always recurse lower directories

# No path is required (assumes PWD) but if it is provided, it must be relative to the current directory


# Usage:

# docdoc                                    - lists the #~# comments from all files in the current and lower directories 

# /etc/docker_qmul/includes/docdoc ../base  - lists the #~# comments from all files in the /etc/docker_qmul/base and lower directories
